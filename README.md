# World-Generator
A world generator developed in Unity

The goal of this project is to create a procedurally-generated, hex-based map/terrain creation engine and to eventually carry that forwards into a turn-based strategy game.
The project is currently undergoing refactoring into the Entity Component System model of programming.
